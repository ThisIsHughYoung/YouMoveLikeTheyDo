# You Move Like They Do!



This project aims to emulate the physics of various 8-bit and 16-bit games in-browser. It also serves as a tactile demo on the rules behind their movement systems, and the ingenuity of their original designs.


### Features planned:

* Playable replicas of 8-bit and 16-bit game engines
* Display of sensor lines, collision info
* Live parameter tweaking
* Configurable controls

### Not a Game Emulator

The goal is not to recreate entire games; that's what we have emulators for. YMLTD strives to recreate the *feeling* of certain video games by emulating their engine's rules, not the game itself.
